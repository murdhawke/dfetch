# Node.js Data Fetching and Storage Server

This Node.js server is designed to fetch and store data from various sources.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: The server can retrieve data from external APIs, databases, or other sources.
- **Data Storage**: It can store fetched data in a database for later retrieval or analysis.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for clients to interact with the server, such as fetching data or storing new data.
- **Scalability**: Built with Node.js, which allows for easy scalability to handle large volumes of data and requests.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables for database connection details, API keys, or any other configuration needed. Refer to `.env.example` for guidance.

3. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start` to start the Node.js server.

## Usage

Once the server is running, clients can interact with it through its RESTful API endpoints. Examples include:

- **Fetching Data**: Clients can make GET requests to retrieve data from the server.
- **Storing Data**: Clients can make POST requests to send new data to the server for storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **@databases/pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js, used for database interactions.
